# Shopify Backend Intern 2022 Challenge

## Replit Steps (OR watch on https://youtu.be/5l3z72WRLpQ):
1. Type and enter in the shell/console: bash dependencies
2. Run app.py (python ./app.py) or hit the green "Run" button on Replit.
3. Please click the "Open in a new tab" button in the top right browser window (seems to work better).
   
## Git clone steps:
1. Make sure python3 is installed
2. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/bluepra/shopify-backend-challenge.git
3. Go to the project folder in the terminal
4. Type and enter in the terminal: bash dependencies
6. Run app.py: python ./app.py
7. Click on the link that the terminal shows - this should open your browser

## How to use the inventory:
1. Click the Add/Edit Warehouse button to add a warehouse
2. Once you have a warehouse, you can create and add items to the inventory
3. Hit "Edit" to edit items or warehouses
4. Hit "Delete" to remove items or warehouses
5. Removing a warehouse causes all of its items to be removed from inventory as well


## Improvements to make:
1. Seperate inventory and warehouse code into 2 different python files
2. Use foreign key constraints in SQLAlchemy to deal with ON DELETE CASCADE 
3. Host the database non-locally
4. Make the warehouse table more comprehensive
5. Do more thorough error checking on user input
